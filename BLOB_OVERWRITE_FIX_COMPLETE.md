# 🎉 BLOB STORAGE OVERWRITE FIX - DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE

## ✅ **CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY**

**Status**: Blob storage overwrite permission added to **morningvoyage.co**  
**Commit**: `759e507` - Add allowOverwrite:true to blob storage  
**Issue**: `Vercel Blob: This blob already exists, use allowOverwrite: true`  
**Solution**: Added overwrite permission to both CSV save locations

## 🔧 **EXACT FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **FIX 1: lib/csv-data.ts** ✅
**Function**: `updateProducts()` - Used by individual product operations
```typescript
await put(BLOB_FILENAME, csvText, {
  access: "public",
  contentType: "text/csv",
  allowOverwrite: true,  // ← ADDED
})
```

### **FIX 2: app/admin/actions.ts** ✅
**Function**: `uploadCsvAction()` - Used by CSV file uploads
```typescript
await put(BLOB_FILENAME, standardizedCsvText, { 
  access: "public", 
  contentType: "text/csv",
  allowOverwrite: true  // ← ADDED
})
```
