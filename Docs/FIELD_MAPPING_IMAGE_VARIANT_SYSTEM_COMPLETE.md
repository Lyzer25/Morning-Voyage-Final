# ðŸŽ¯ Field Mapping, Image Management & Variant System - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## âœ… **PHASE A: CSV Header/Value Normalization - COMPLETE**

### **Files Modified:**
- `lib/csv-helpers.ts` - Enhanced with comprehensive normalization system
- `lib/csv-data.ts` - Integrated normalization functions into CSV processing

### **Key Features Implemented:**
1. **`norm()` Function**: Case/space/parentheses tolerant header normalization
2. **Comprehensive `HEADER_ALIASES`**: Maps any CSV header variation to canonical UPPERCASE columns

   - `normalizeTastingNotes()` - Proper comma-separated processing
   - `normalizeRoastLevel()` - Standardizes roast level values
4. **`fromCsvRow()` Function**: Converts CSV rows to normalized Product objects
5. **originalPrice Defaulting**: Sets `originalPrice = price` on initial import

### **CSV Compatibility:**
- âœ… Handles "Shipping( First Item) " (with trailing spaces)
- âœ… Handles "SHIPPINGFIRST" vs "shipping first item" variations
- âœ… Case-insensitive header matching
- âœ… Handles non-breaking spaces and multiple whitespace
- âœ… Parentheses normalization

## âœ… **PHASE B: API Cache Verification - COMPLETE**

### **Status:** 
- Previous implementation already had comprehensive cache-busting
- API endpoints verified to use `fetchCache = 'force-no-store'`
- Admin polling uses cache-buster timestamps
- No additional changes needed

   - File validation (type, size limits)

2. **Image Management**:
   - Upload to Vercel Blob with `products/images/` prefix
   - Automatic filename generation with timestamps
   - Image preview gallery with hover controls
   - Delete functionality with confirmation
   - Reorder functionality (move up/down)

3. **Visual Design**:
   - Purple-themed section to distinguish from other form sections
   - Responsive grid layout (2-3 columns)
   - Main image badge indicator
   - Professional card-based image display
   - Loading states and error handling

4. **Integration**:
   - Seamlessly integrated into existing coffee form
   - Images state properly bound to form submission
   - Toast notifications for user feedback
   - Proper error handling and validation

## âœ… **PHASE D: Variant Family Management - COMPLETE**

### **Files Created:**
- `lib/variant-grouping.ts` - Variant detection and family management logic
- `components/admin/variant-manager.tsx` - Family-based product management UI

### **Key Features Implemented:**

#### **Variant Detection Logic:**
- **Smart Family Grouping**: Groups products by shared properties (origin, roast level, tasting notes)
- **Base Name Extraction**: Removes size/format indicators to find product families
- **Automatic Sorting**: Orders variants by size (12oz â†’ 1lb â†’ 2lb) then format (whole-bean â†’ ground â†’ instant â†’ pods)

#### **Variant Manager UI:**
- **Family View**: Collapsible cards showing related products grouped together
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Purple theme for variant families
  - Individual product cards for standalone items
  - Badges showing variant count, roast level, origin
  - Average pricing display

#### **Management Features:**
- **Individual Product Actions**:
  - Edit specific SKU
  - Duplicate product (for creating similar variants)
  - Delete individual variants
- **Family Bulk Actions**:
  - "Edit Family Properties" - Update shared fields across all variants
  - "Feature/Unfeature All Variants" - Bulk status changes
  - Expand/collapse all families

#### **Smart Suggestions:**
- **Missing Variant Detection**: Shows combinations not yet created
- **SKU Generation Suggestions**: Proposes new SKUs for missing variants
- **Click-to-Create**: Badges for easy variant creation

#### **Shared Properties Display:**
- Shows properties common across family members
- Displays mixed/different properties appropriately
- Real-time family analysis
