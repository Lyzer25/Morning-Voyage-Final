## üìû Questions & Clarifications

### Common Scenarios
**Q: Product has reflective packaging - how to handle reflections?**
A: Use polarizing filters or adjust lighting to minimize distracting reflections while maintaining material authenticity.

**Q: Should lifestyle/contextual elements be included?**
A: Keep thumbnails product-focused. Hero images can include minimal context (coffee beans, brewing equipment) but product remains primary focus.

**Q: How to handle products with multiple variants (colors, sizes)?**
A: Photograph the most popular/representative variant. Additional variants will be specified if needed.

**Q: Background preference for coffee products?**
A: White or very light neutral backgrounds for thumbnails. Hero images can use textured surfaces (wood, marble, linen) that complement brand colors.
