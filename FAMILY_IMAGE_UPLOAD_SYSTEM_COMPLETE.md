# Family Image Upload System - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
Successfully implemented comprehensive image upload system for coffee families and fixed dynamic category badges in the admin interface.

## ✅ PRIORITY 1: Dynamic Category Badge Fix - COMPLETE

### Problem Solved
- Fixed hardcoded "Coffee" category badge in ProductManager
- Admin was showing incorrect badges for non-coffee products

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Added dynamic category badge helper
const getCategoryBadge = (category: string) => {
  switch (category?.toLowerCase()) {
    case 'coffee':
      return <Badge className="bg-amber-100 text-amber-800"><Coffee />Coffee</Badge>
    case 'subscription':
      return <Badge className="bg-blue-100 text-blue-800"><Users />Subscription</Badge>
    case 'gift-set':
      return <Badge className="bg-green-100 text-green-800"><Gift />Gift Set</Badge>
    case 'equipment':
      return <Badge className="bg-purple-100 text-purple-800"><Wrench />Equipment</Badge>
    default:
      return <Badge className="bg-gray-100 text-gray-800"><Package />General</Badge>
  }
}
```
